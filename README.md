# metar-asos-iem

The IEM parser functions will download each station for each state provided. Thus, meteograms for each station are easy to use with this data, but plotting on a map require a bit more work under the hood. 

 * Each individual time from each station file will need to merged to a new file, and all time misalignments will need to be addressed. 

Good luck, you have... 1 hour!
